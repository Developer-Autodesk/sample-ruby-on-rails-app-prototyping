## Motivation

Our View and Data API Beta adds powerful 2D and 3D viewing functionality to your web apps.
Our REST and JavaScript API makes it easier to create applications that can view, zoom and interact with 2D and
3D models from over 60+ model formats with just a web browser, no plugin required!

This app shows you what you can do with the API.


## Description

This Ruby on Rails application is meant to allow users to register and upload models made in over 60 different file formats. Users can store URNs, view their uploaded models and set publically visible viewables. A judge password allows judges to register and view the user set viewables.
